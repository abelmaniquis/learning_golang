Here is the standard 'hello world' program.

To run the program, put the code in hello-world.go and
use go run:

    go run hello.go

Sometimes we'll want to build our programs into binaries.
We can use this using go build:

    go build hello.go

We can then execute the built binary directly:
    ./hello
