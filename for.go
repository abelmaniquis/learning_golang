/*

for is Go's only looping construct. There are three different types
of for loops

The most basic type, with a single condition.

a classic initial/condition/after for loop

for without a condition will loop repeatedly until
you break out of a loop or return from the enclosing
function

Weâ€™ll see some other for forms later when we look at range statements,
channels, and other data structures.
